## Firmware and hardware

| Firmware ID | Version | Revision | Build | Declared Modules | Default | Catalogue status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `376` | `-1` | `-1` | `-1` | `1` | Catalogue default | Deprecated |

Version/revision/build `-1` retains wildcard or unspecified applicability in the catalogue; it is distinct from Deprecated status. Status and default are metadata of this historical source snapshot, not present-day market availability or installed state. Installed firmware must be corroborated through the applicable diagnostic context.

No installed release, hardware revision or microcontroller fingerprint is corroborated. Missing build rows mean unknown build, not build zero.

## Module, Object, and Virgin Object model

| Firmware | Module slot | External Object | Catalogue placement | Catalogue slot row ID | Catalogue Object key | Object/Firmware relation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `376` | `1` | `193` Gateway SCS-ZigBee | Fixed/designated metadata | `990` | `465` | `596` |

Module slot is the Device-local placement, not a database row identifier. Fixed/designated metadata and candidate membership do not prove the installed active Object; use the conditions and runtime diagnostics in their established contexts.

### Virgin Objects

| Firmware | External Virgin Object | Module slots | Permitted external Objects | Catalogue Virgin Object key | Firmware/Virgin relation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| all | None associated | Not applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable |

## Configuration modes

| Firmware | Mode | Catalogue mode | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `376` | Advanced Configuration | `2` | Association key `2` |


No connection associations are stored for these firmware definitions. This does not negate a documented route through an external gateway.

## Firmware-scoped configuration

Domains and defaults are catalogue evidence. `AID` is a literal mask with no stored default or established character set; it is not a physical configurator.

| Firmware | Field | Catalogue domain | Catalogue default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `376` | `AID` | `********` = AID | Not specified in source | Device identity token; not a physical configurator |

## Object configuration surfaces

The following domains and defaults describe reusable Object definitions in the canonical MyHOME Suite `3.5.38` catalogue. Numeric values are catalogue values; product units and physical configurator limits are separate scopes. Defaults do not establish installed state. Apply the firmware-specific restrictions under Conditions, filters, and conversions after resolving the active Object.

### Object `193` - Gateway SCS-ZigBee

Catalogue Object key `465` maps to external Object `193`.

| Field | Reusable domain | Reusable default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `A` | `0..10` | `0` | Area |
| `PL` | `0..15` | `0` | Light point |
| `MODE` | `0` = SCS2; `1` = SCS1 | `0` | Mode for SCS-Zigbee |

## Conditions, filters, and conversions

### Slot conditions

| Firmware | Module slot | External Object | Condition ID | Stored predicate | Conversion rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| all | Not applicable | Not applicable | None | No slot-condition rows associated | None |

Empty predicates, missing condition rows and fixed placement metadata are not evidence of unconditional runtime activation. Preserve out-of-domain selectors and unresolved symbols as source irregularities; do not invent selection precedence.

### Object/Firmware restrictions

| Firmware | External Object | Filter ID | Field | Effective catalogue domain | Reusable default | Evidence / applicability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `376` | `193` | `1102` | `MODE` | `1` = SCS1 | `0` | Mode for SCS-Zigbee; reusable default `0` is outside this subset; filter supplies no replacement default |

### Device-specific conversions

| Referenced rule | Item-side condition | Object configuration result | Source path / limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | Not applicable | No conversion reference associated with these slot rows | Canonical catalogue |

No conversion rule is attached to these slot rows. Resolve the active Object and apply its exact Firmware restrictions; generic resolution and ambiguity handling remain in [Catalogue Resolution](../../internals/catalogue-resolution.md).

## Diagnostic applicability

| Diagnostic surface | Device-specific use | Canonical reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIMENSION 1` | Corroborate item model `202` and variant identity in this Device’s diagnostic system context | [Device Identity](../../diagnostics/dim1-device-identity.md) |
| `DIMENSION 2` | Read installed firmware and compare with the applicability table | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 3` | Obtain hardware revision; no source-backed installed value | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 6` | Obtain microcontroller identity; no fingerprint retained | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 30` | Resolve active Modules/Objects independently of candidate metadata | [Modules](../../diagnostics/dim30-modules.md) |
| `DIMENSION 32` | Corroborate installed addressing and distinguish physical from reusable ranges | [Addressing](../../diagnostics/dim32-addressing.md) |
| `DIMENSION 35` | Compare installed configuration with the exact firmware/Object restrictions | [Configuration](../../diagnostics/dim35-configuration.md) |

These are catalogue-derived diagnostic candidates. No Device-specific response or support across all commercial variants is established by a hardware capture.

## Functional applicability

| Catalogue Object / role | Applicability | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `193` - Gateway SCS-ZigBee | Applicable only after resolving its Firmware/Module placement and attached restrictions | Canonical catalogue relationship |


These are catalogue-derived functional roles, not a declaration that every candidate is simultaneously configured. Product UI pages may control remote subsystems without instantiating their Objects locally. System/model mappings in Identity are not WHO values. See [Functional Protocol](../../functional/) for canonical system semantics.

## Observed behavior and corroboration

No publishable Device-specific hardware captures or experiments are retained for this cluster. Manufacturer operating descriptions are documented behavior; catalogue relationships are implementation capability metadata. Neither is a measured response from an installed Physical Device.

## Programming

The database places gateway Object `193` in slot `1`. Validate its addressing and apply the attached restriction `MODE=1` (SCS1); reusable `MODE=0` (SCS2) is outside that subset and no replacement default is supplied. Resolve actual SCS/ZigBee topology before treating a downstream radio device as this gateway’s own Physical Device identity.

Apply the complete catalogue domains, defaults, conditions and relation-specific filters above. A legal reusable value is not necessarily legal for this Firmware. Configuration paths and package labels are source associations, not verified payload encoding. The generic validation/session algorithm remains in [Programming](../../programming/).

## Source reconciliation

048832 and BMNE4000 are explicit manufacturer database commercial identities of the same technical item. Exact manufacturer PDF discovery did not yield an applicable original: current numeric/legacy routes were absent or returned catalogue shells/errors. AUTOMATISME contains no BMNE4000/048832 match and supplies no transferable ratings. The item’s deprecated catalogue status and unspecified version tuple do not establish current market availability or installed firmware.

The relation-specific restriction table explicitly identifies reusable defaults outside the permitted subset. These are catalogue inconsistencies; no replacement default is inferred. Runtime Configuration and manufacturer modes must be corroborated before selecting a substitute.

## Evidence limits and open work

Exact installation/commissioning instructions, supply/current, mounting, radio specification, pairing/reset behavior and installed diagnostics remain documentation or observation gaps. Catalogue identity is established; it is not unresolved because these PDFs are missing.

No installed release, hardware revision or microcontroller fingerprint has been established for this cluster. The diagnostic table describes source-derived candidates. Further manufacturer discovery and hardware corroboration remain partial; catalogue extraction and source reconciliation are complete for the retained evidence listed here.

## Sources

Complete implementation extraction uses the retained canonical `MHCatalogue.db`, SHA-256 `f0c9d24f988937d1c8654c72b034fc02c7aacb37dc099bbc926f0c58363fe8e5`. Commercial/system/firmware/build associations, reusable fields and their ranges/defaults, slot/Object/Virgin relationships, every attached filter/condition/conversion, modes, connections, parameters and packages are separately scoped above.
