## Conditions, filters, and conversions

| Surface | IDs / scope | Device-specific interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Object filters | `148`, `149`, `150`, `151`, `152`, `153`, `154`, `155`, `156`, `157`, `158`, `159`, `2104`, `2119`, `2134`, `2150`, `2342`, `2343`, `2365`, `2398`, `2448`, `2460` | relation-specific restrictions; apply before exposing reusable Object values |
| Slot conditions | `4439`, `4461`, `4477`, `4491`, `4505` | resolve Object/slot applicability before programming |
| Conversion rules | catalogue-scoped | preserve canonical condition/conversion evaluation; do not infer unconditional capability |

## Diagnostic applicability

| Diagnostic surface | Device-specific use | Canonical reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIMENSION 1` | corroborate technical identity for catalogue item `56` / `modobj = 39` | [Device Identity](../../diagnostics/dim1-device-identity.md) |
| `DIMENSION 2` | select/corroborate the applicable catalogue firmware tuple while preserving wildcard semantics | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 30` | corroborate declared Module/Object topology (`119`, `128`, `164`, `165`, `166`, `168`, `431`) | [Modules](../../diagnostics/dim30-modules.md) |
| `DIMENSION 32` | corroborate addressing only after the active Module/Object context is resolved | [Addressing](../../diagnostics/dim32-addressing.md) |
| `DIMENSION 35` | inspect physical/software configuration against firmware fields, conditions and filters | [Configuration](../../diagnostics/dim35-configuration.md) |

## Functional applicability

Long-range wall/ceiling PIR and daylight sensor for SCS Lighting Management and MyHOME. The canonical catalogue exposes the same seven reusable sensor Object families as the other BMSE wall sensors, with Device-specific filters and conditions selecting applicable fields.

## Observed behavior and corroboration

No additional publishable Device-specific hardware/runtime observation is currently retained for this exact technical item.

## Programming

Programming must select the applicable firmware, resolve active Module/Object relationships through catalogue conditions and filters, and preserve the documented configuration-mode boundary. Product-programmed Devices should not be reduced to generic physical-configurator semantics.

## Source reconciliation

The canonical catalogue binds `BMSE2004` and `048829` to item `56`. The dedicated BTicino technical sheet directly documents `BMSE2004`; the Legrand `048829` cross-reference remains catalogue-derived in the retained publisher dossier.

## Evidence limits and open work

- Archive the identified publisher documents locally where licensing and repository policy allow.
- Capture a sanitized hardware fingerprint covering identity, firmware, Modules, addressing and configuration.
- Corroborate relation filters and condition-selected topology against MyHOME Suite and controlled hardware observations.
