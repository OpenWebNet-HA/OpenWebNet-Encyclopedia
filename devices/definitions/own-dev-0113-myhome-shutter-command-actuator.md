# MYHOME shutter command and actuator

## Summary

This MYHOME device combines a shutter-actuator role with configurable commands for lighting, automation and scenarios. Its catalogue identity and combined purpose are established, while the motor ratings, wiring and physical control arrangement still require exact-product documentation.

| Field | Value | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device ID | `OWN-DEV-0113` | Project identity |
| Technical description | MYHOME shutter command and actuator | Canonical catalogue and source-scoped manufacturer documents |
| Commercial identities | `H4672M2S`, `LN4672M2S`, `067587` | All three SKU-to-item mappings explicitly established by the manufacturer catalogue |
| Catalogue item | `2248` | MyHOME Suite `3.5.38`, canonical `MHCatalogue.db` |
| Main catalogue system | Automation | Main system association |
| Item model / `modobj` | `112` | Main association; independent of project ID |
| Firmware definition | `775` | Catalogue firmware IDs; version/build table below |
| Declared Modules | `4` | Firmware metadata |
| Categories | Actuators, Commands, User interfaces, Multifunction devices | Source-derived roles |

The catalogue defines one Shutter actuator Module, two command Modules and a separate User interface Module. Four logical Modules do not establish four physical outputs. The manufacturer catalogue explicitly establishes all three SKU-to-item mappings. Exact-product PDFs have not been found; physical specifications remain a documentation gap.

## Commercial identities

| Brand / line | Reference | Relationship | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BTicino - Axolute | `H4672M2S` | Established catalogue identity | `EN_DEVICE` record `2604` explicitly links this SKU to item `2248` |
| BTicino | `LN4672M2S` | Established catalogue identity | `EN_DEVICE` record `2603` explicitly links this SKU to item `2248` |
| Legrand - Céliane | `067587` | Established catalogue identity | `EN_DEVICE` record `2605` explicitly links this SKU to item `2248` |

The manufacturer catalogue explicitly links all three SKUs to this technical item through `EN_DEVICE.id_item` relationships. It labels the H reference Axolute, the LN reference Living (internal `L/N/NT`), and the Legrand reference Céliane. Those catalogue identities are established independently of PDF availability. Online searches did not locate exact-product sheets; unavailable product endpoints do not invalidate the catalogue records. The retained similar-reference source describes `AR-67587` as an Epure tiltable detector. It is excluded as product evidence: reference resemblance does not establish equivalence or contradict these SKU-to-item mappings.

## Physical and electrical characteristics

| Property | Value | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalogue-described format | Two-module reference suffix; exact physical format not independently corroborated | Canonical commercial description/reference; not a measured assembly |
| Dimensions, supply/current, operating/storage range | Unknown for these catalogue-established identities | No exact matching retained manufacturer specification |
| Outputs, contacts, motor/load ratings and mounting | Unknown for the physical Device | Logical actuator/command topology is not a load rating or wiring diagram |
| Keys, covers, LEDs, sensors and configurator sockets | Unknown physical arrangement | Reusable UI/configuration fields do not prove construction |

## Identity

| Field | Value | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EN_ITEM.id_item` | `2248` | Canonical catalogue |
| Technical item description | Comando-Attuatore MYHOME Tapparelle | Canonical catalogue |
| Item family | 0; key `2` | Canonical catalogue |
| Main system | Automation; key `1` | `AS_ITEM_SYSTEM` |
| Main item model / `modobj` | `112` | `AS_ITEM_SYSTEM` |
| Commercial record count | `3` | `EN_DEVICE` |

### Catalogue system and bus scope

| System | Item model / modobj | Main mapping | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Automation | `112` | Yes | Canonical item/system relationship |

| Catalogue bus | Level | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automation | private riser | Canonical item/bus relationship |

These associations describe software applicability, not physical connector counts or observed services.

## Firmware and hardware

| Firmware ID | Version | Revision | Build | Declared Modules | Default | Catalogue status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `775` | `1` | `0` | No build row | `4` | Not catalogue default | Official |

Version/revision/build `-1` retains wildcard or unspecified applicability in the catalogue; it is distinct from Deprecated status. Status and default are metadata of this historical source snapshot, not present-day market availability or installed state. Installed firmware must be corroborated through the applicable diagnostic context.

No installed release, hardware revision or microcontroller fingerprint is corroborated. Missing build rows mean unknown build, not build zero.

### Parameter and package associations

No firmware parameter-file association is stored for this item.

No `AS_FW_PACKAGE` association is stored. This is catalogue coverage, not a claim that manufacturer firmware downloads never existed.

## Module, Object, and Virgin Object model

| Firmware | Module slot | External Object | Catalogue placement | Catalogue slot row ID | Catalogue Object key | Object/Firmware relation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `775` | `1` | `218` Shutter actuator | Fixed/designated metadata | `3081` | `514` | `1474` |
| `775` | `2` | `400` Light control | Fixed/designated metadata | `3109` | `400` | `1493` |
| `775` | `2` | `401` Automation control | Candidate alternative | `3103` | `401` | `1490` |
| `775` | `2` | `402` Lock/unlock actuator control | Candidate alternative | `3101` | `402` | `1489` |
| `775` | `2` | `406` Scheduled scenario PLUS | Candidate alternative | `3099` | `406` | `1488` |
| `775` | `2` | `408` Open lock control | Candidate alternative | `3097` | `408` | `1487` |
| `775` | `2` | `427` Floor call control | Candidate alternative | `3112` | `427` | `1495` |
| `775` | `2` | `430` Staircase light control | Candidate alternative | `3095` | `430` | `1486` |
| `775` | `2` | `463` Load control actuator visualization | Candidate alternative | `3083` | `492` | `1476` |
| `775` | `2` | `145` Shutter control (2 slots) | Candidate alternative | `3125` | `650` | `1504` |
| `775` | `3` | `400` Light control | Fixed/designated metadata | `3110` | `400` | `1493` |
| `775` | `3` | `401` Automation control | Candidate alternative | `3104` | `401` | `1490` |
| `775` | `3` | `402` Lock/unlock actuator control | Candidate alternative | `3102` | `402` | `1489` |
| `775` | `3` | `406` Scheduled scenario PLUS | Candidate alternative | `3100` | `406` | `1488` |
| `775` | `3` | `408` Open lock control | Candidate alternative | `3098` | `408` | `1487` |
| `775` | `3` | `427` Floor call control | Candidate alternative | `3113` | `427` | `1495` |
| `775` | `3` | `430` Staircase light control | Candidate alternative | `3096` | `430` | `1486` |
| `775` | `3` | `463` Load control actuator visualization | Candidate alternative | `3084` | `492` | `1476` |
| `775` | `4` | `143` User interface settings for command | Fixed/designated metadata | `3111` | `644` | `1494` |

Module slot is the Device-local placement, not a database row identifier. Fixed/designated metadata and candidate membership do not prove the installed active Object; use the conditions and runtime diagnostics in their established contexts.

### Virgin Objects

| Firmware | External Virgin Object | Module slots | Permitted external Objects | Catalogue Virgin Object key | Firmware/Virgin relation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `775` | `501` Special double command virgin | `2`, `3` | `400`, `401`, `402`, `403`, `404`, `405`, `406`, `407`, `408`, `409`, `427`, `430` | `501` | `99` |

Slot `1` designates Shutter actuator Object `218` (catalogue key `514`). Command slots `2/3` each have eight common alternatives: `400`, `401`, `402`, `406`, `408`, `427`, `430`, `463`. Two-slot Object `145` has one stored starting placement at slot `2`; UI Object `143` is in slot `4`. Virgin Object `501` covers command slots `2/3` only. Virgin `501` permits `400..409`, `427` and `430`, while direct firmware membership excludes `403/404/405/407/409` and adds `145/463`; these relations must remain separate. No selection predicate or conversion rule reconciles them automatically.

## Configuration modes

### Complete catalogue mode and connection associations

| Firmware | Mode | Catalogue mode | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `775` | Physical configuration | `0` | Canonical firmware/mode association |
| `775` | Virtual Configuration | `1` | Canonical firmware/mode association |
| `775` | Advanced Configuration | `2` | Canonical firmware/mode association |

No firmware/connection association is stored; this does not imply that the physical Device lacks a bus connector.
Product setup procedures and catalogue mode identifiers have different scopes. A mode association does not prove every reusable Object field is physically available.

## Firmware-scoped configuration

Domains and defaults are catalogue evidence. `AID` is a literal mask with no stored default or established character set; it is not a physical configurator.

| Firmware | Field | Catalogue domain | Catalogue default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `775` | `AID` | `********` = AID | Not specified in source | Device identity token; not a physical configurator |
| `775` | `A1` | `0..9` | `0` | Configurator A1 (0-9) |
| `775` | `PL1` | `0..9` | `0` | PL1 - (0-9) |
| `775` | `M1` | `0..1`; `3..7`; `10` = `OFF`; `12` = `UP/DOWN`; `13` = `UP/DOWN` monostable; `15` = `PUL` | `0` | Modality; Mode physical configurator (0-8, `O/I`,`OFF`,`ON`,SU_GIU,SU_GIU_M,`CEN`,`PUL`) |
| `775` | `A2` | `0..9`; `12` = `GEN`; `13` = `GR`; `14` = `AMB` | `0` | Automation A addressing space (for configurator A2) |
| `775` | `PL2` | `0..9` | `0` | PL2 - (0-9) |
| `775` | `M2` | `0..8`; `9` = `O/I`; `10` = `OFF`; `11` = `ON`; `12` = `UP/DOWN`; `13` = `UP/DOWN` monostable; `15` = `PUL` | `0` | Modality; Mode physical configurator (0-8, `O/I`,`OFF`,`ON`,SU_GIU,SU_GIU_M,`CEN`,`PUL`) |

## Object configuration surfaces

The following domains and defaults describe reusable Object definitions in the canonical MyHOME Suite `3.5.38` catalogue. Numeric values are catalogue values; product units and physical configurator limits are separate scopes. Defaults do not establish installed state. Apply the firmware-specific restrictions under Conditions, filters, and conversions after resolving the active Object.

### Semantic review findings

The four declared Modules comprise one Object `218` shutter actuator, two command positions and UI Object `143`. SHUTTER_TYPE filter `4618` admits only `3` despite default `0`; the complete 40-field motor/preset/calibration/group surface is preserved. HIGH/LOW byte names establish source representation, not a tested encoding. Five Virgin-only candidate Objects add 28 fields; neither their reachability nor overlap precedence is established.

## Conditions, filters, and conversions

### Slot conditions

| Firmware | Module slot | External Object | Condition ID | Stored predicate | Conversion rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| all | Not applicable | Not applicable | None | No slot-condition rows associated | None |

Empty predicates, missing condition rows and fixed placement metadata are not evidence of unconditional runtime activation. Preserve out-of-domain selectors and unresolved symbols as source irregularities; do not invent selection precedence.

### Device-specific conversions

| Referenced rule | Item-side condition | Object configuration result | Source path / limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | Not applicable | No conversion reference associated with these slot rows | Canonical catalogue |

No conversion reference is attached to these slot rows. Resolve the active Object and apply its firmware-specific domain restrictions separately. Generic evaluation and ambiguity handling remain in [Catalogue Resolution](../../internals/catalogue-resolution.md).

## Diagnostic applicability

| Diagnostic surface | Device-specific use | Canonical reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIMENSION 1` | Corroborate item model `112` and variant identity in this Device’s diagnostic system context | [Device Identity](../../diagnostics/dim1-device-identity.md) |
| `DIMENSION 2` | Read installed firmware and compare with the applicability table | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 3` | Obtain hardware revision; no source-backed installed value | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 6` | Obtain microcontroller identity; no fingerprint retained | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 30` | Resolve active Modules/Objects independently of candidate metadata | [Modules](../../diagnostics/dim30-modules.md) |
| `DIMENSION 32` | Corroborate installed addressing and distinguish physical from reusable ranges | [Addressing](../../diagnostics/dim32-addressing.md) |
| `DIMENSION 35` | Compare installed configuration with the exact firmware/Object restrictions | [Configuration](../../diagnostics/dim35-configuration.md) |

These are catalogue-derived diagnostic candidates. No Device-specific response or support across all commercial variants is established by a hardware capture.

## Functional applicability

| Role | Conditional applicability | Canonical evidence / reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shutter actuator | One designated Object `218` placement; exact accepted motor/configuration scope requires corroboration | [`WHO 2`](../../functional/who-2-automation/) |
| Lighting command | Object `400` when selected; address, reference actuator, dimming and timing domains are configuration metadata | [`WHO 1`](../../functional/who-1-lighting/) |
| Automation command | Object `401` or two-slot Object `145` when selected; motor actuation requires a separate actuator role | [`WHO 2`](../../functional/who-2-automation/) |
| Actuator lock/unlock | Object `402`; configured actuator eligibility rather than a physical lock output | Object `402` catalogue association |
| Scheduled scenario PLUS | Object `406`; scenario number, button and auxiliary-event fields as defined | [CEN+ in `WHO 25`](../../functional/who-25-transversal/cen-plus.md) |
| Video-entry command | Object `408` lock, `427` floor call or `430` staircase light when selected | [`WHO 6`](../../functional/who-6-basic-video-door-entry/) |
| Load management | Object `463` visualization/override; not evidence of built-in metering | [`WHO 18`](../../functional/who-18-energy-management/) |
| Command UI | Object `143`; configured indicators do not establish physical LEDs or sensors | Reusable catalogue UI definition |

## Observed behavior and corroboration

No publishable Device-specific hardware captures or experiments are retained for this cluster. Manufacturer operating descriptions are documented behavior; catalogue relationships are implementation capability metadata. Neither is a measured response from an installed Physical Device.

## Programming

The catalogue configuration modes and firmware `775` associations are listed above. Resolve the active Object and preserve the command, actuator and UI placements separately. Candidate membership is not simultaneous activation, and a multi-slot Object cannot be assumed to coexist with another Object occupying its span. No slot-condition or referenced conversion row supplies selection precedence.

Apply the Object `218` motor-type restriction before considering calibration. The retained high/low-byte labels name a split source representation; no tested conversion or calibration sequence is established here. Do not prescribe movement or infer a safe motor rating without the exact physical product and manufacturer wiring instructions.

Object `430` N1 is restricted to `100..255`, excluding default `0`; no replacement is established. Object `145` DEST_LEV omits value `14` in both its reusable domain and the retained filter, even though similarly named destination domains include it. Preserve those exact scopes. No exact-product manual establishes commissioning, reset, transfer, update, physical configurator meanings or wiring; those procedures remain open rather than borrowed from similarly named controls.

## Source reconciliation

The complete canonical catalogue defines this technical item and its catalogue-established identities, firmware, Module/Object/Virgin topology, legal fields, filters, modes and related parameter/connection/package metadata. The retained publisher source is incorporated as excluded similar-reference evidence only. Its dimensions, electrical ratings, functions and installation instructions describe a different product and are not attributed to this Device.

| Issue | Reconciliation / unresolved limit | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalogue identity | All three SKUs explicitly map to item `2248`; missing exact-product PDFs affect documentation coverage, not identity status | Canonical `EN_DEVICE` records |
| Excluded source applicability | The retained similar-reference source describes a different product/line. No equivalence is established, and its specifications are not transferred; this does not invalidate the catalogue mappings | Documentation inventory and source-scoped comparison |
| Shared item versus physical substitution | The H, LN and Legrand references share this catalogue technical item. That grouping does not establish interchangeable physical parts or equivalence to newer Living Now K-series products | Explicit catalogue mappings; physical interchangeability not documented |
| Firmware build | Firmware `775` is `1.0` with no build row; not default. Neither catalogue status nor absent build proves a shipped release | Canonical `EN_FIRMWARE` / build associations |
| Staircase-light default | Object `430` N1 effective domain `100..255` excludes default `0`; no replacement | Attached firmware filter |
| Destination-domain hole | Object `145` DEST_LEV omits `14`; similar domains do not fill the gap | Reusable Object and firmware filter |
| Virgin/direct membership | Allowed generic Virgin Objects and firmware-associated active Objects differ; no automatic conversion is proven | Exact relations enumerated above |
| Motor-type restriction | Object `218` SHUTTER_TYPE is restricted to `3` Standard with slats, excluding reusable default `0`; no replacement | Filter `4618` |
| Calibration fields | Up/down travel and slat timing HIGH/LOW fields and step count are reusable configuration values, not measurements from installed hardware | Object `218` and nine attached actuator filters |
| Firmware selector prose | M1/M2 descriptions mention values, including `CEN`, beyond their stored legal subsets. M1 and M2 have distinct domains and A1 differs from A2 | Seven firmware fields including AID |

## Evidence limits and open work

- Locate exact-product sheets, instructions or packaging for `H4672M2S`, `LN4672M2S` and `067587` to establish physical specifications and product-specific procedures.
- Establish physical ratings, wiring, mounting, controls and complete commissioning/reset/update procedures.
- Corroborate accepted Object selection, Virgin transitions, multi-slot occupancy and firmware restrictions; no parameter-file association is stored for this item.
- Obtain sanitized hardware evidence for installed firmware/build, hardware revision, MCU identity and functional behavior; none is retained.
