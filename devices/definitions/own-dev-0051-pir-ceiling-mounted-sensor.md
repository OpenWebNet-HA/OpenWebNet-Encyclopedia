## Conditions, filters, and conversions

| Surface | IDs / scope | Device-specific interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Object filters | `175`, `176`, `177`, `178`, `180`, `181`, `182`, `183`, `187`, `188`, `189`, `190`, `353`, `354`, `355`, `356`, `2108`, `2123`, `2138`, `2154`, `2212`, `2213`, `2322`, `2323`, `2324`, `2325`, `2326`, `2327`, `2328`, `2329`, `2330`, `2369`, `2390`, `2451`, `2463` | relation-specific restrictions; apply before exposing reusable Object values |
| Slot conditions | `4439`, `4461`, `4477`, `4491`, `4505` | resolve Object/slot applicability before programming |
| Conversion rules | catalogue-scoped | preserve canonical condition/conversion evaluation; do not infer unconditional capability |

## Diagnostic applicability

| Diagnostic surface | Device-specific use | Canonical reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIMENSION 1` | corroborate technical identity for catalogue item `45` / `modobj = 32` | [Device Identity](../../diagnostics/dim1-device-identity.md) |
| `DIMENSION 2` | select/corroborate the applicable catalogue firmware tuple while preserving wildcard semantics | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 30` | corroborate declared Module/Object topology (`119`, `128`, `164`, `165`, `166`, `168`, `431`) | [Modules](../../diagnostics/dim30-modules.md) |
| `DIMENSION 32` | corroborate addressing only after the active Module/Object context is resolved | [Addressing](../../diagnostics/dim32-addressing.md) |
| `DIMENSION 35` | inspect physical/software configuration against firmware fields, conditions and filters | [Configuration](../../diagnostics/dim35-configuration.md) |

## Functional applicability

BUS-powered ceiling presence/daylight sensor using PIR detection. The catalogue exposes presence, daylight, combined daylight/presence, scenario-sensor and regulation Object families; Device-specific filters determine which reusable fields apply.

## Observed behavior and corroboration

No additional publishable Device-specific hardware/runtime observation is currently retained for this exact technical item.

## Programming

Programming must select the applicable firmware, resolve active Module/Object relationships through catalogue conditions and filters, and preserve the documented configuration-mode boundary. Product-programmed Devices should not be reduced to generic physical-configurator semantics.

## Source reconciliation

The canonical catalogue binds `BMSE3001` and `048820` to one technical item. The publisher guide directly identifies both references and documents PIR-only ceiling detection. Reusable Object definitions contain US-related fields, but Device filters suppress or constrain those fields; they are not evidence of ultrasonic hardware.

## Evidence limits and open work

- Archive the identified publisher documents locally where licensing and repository policy allow.
- Capture a sanitized hardware fingerprint covering identity, firmware, Modules, addressing and configuration.
- Corroborate relation filters and condition-selected topology against MyHOME Suite and controlled hardware observations.
