## Conditions, filters, and conversions

| Surface | IDs / scope | Device-specific interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Object filters | `161`, `162`, `163`, `164`, `166`, `167`, `168`, `169`, `170`, `171`, `172`, `173`, `174`, `2106`, `2121`, `2136`, `2152`, `2347`, `2348`, `2349`, `2350`, `2351`, `2352`, `2360`, `2367`, `2393`, `2450`, `2462` | relation-specific restrictions; apply before exposing reusable Object values |
| Slot conditions | `4439`, `4461`, `4477`, `4491`, `4505` | resolve Object/slot applicability before programming |
| Conversion rules | catalogue-scoped | preserve canonical condition/conversion evaluation; do not infer unconditional capability |

## Diagnostic applicability

| Diagnostic surface | Device-specific use | Canonical reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIMENSION 1` | corroborate technical identity for catalogue item `137` / `modobj = 42` | [Device Identity](../../diagnostics/dim1-device-identity.md) |
| `DIMENSION 2` | select/corroborate the applicable catalogue firmware tuple while preserving wildcard semantics | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 30` | corroborate declared Module/Object topology (`119`, `128`, `164`, `165`, `166`, `168`, `431`) | [Modules](../../diagnostics/dim30-modules.md) |
| `DIMENSION 32` | corroborate addressing only after the active Module/Object context is resolved | [Addressing](../../diagnostics/dim32-addressing.md) |
| `DIMENSION 35` | inspect physical/software configuration against firmware fields, conditions and filters | [Configuration](../../diagnostics/dim35-configuration.md) |

## Functional applicability

The canonical catalogue describes this technical item as IP55 PIR wall mounted sensor. Its firmware exposes `7` distinct Object families across the declared Module topology. This definition records those surfaces without treating reusable Object vocabulary as proof of undocumented physical capabilities.

## Observed behavior and corroboration

No additional publishable Device-specific hardware/runtime observation is currently retained for this exact technical item.

## Programming

Programming must select the applicable firmware, resolve active Module/Object relationships through catalogue conditions and filters, and preserve the named configuration-mode boundary. Product-programmed Devices must not be reduced to generic physical-configurator semantics.

## Source reconciliation

The canonical MyHOME Suite catalogue binds `BMSE2006`, `048830` to technical item `137`. A dedicated retained publisher product document for this exact technical item has not yet been reconciled in the Device source archive, so external documentation discovery remains partial.

## Evidence limits and open work

- Locate and archive dedicated publisher documentation for the exact commercial references where available.
- Capture a sanitized hardware fingerprint covering identity, firmware, Modules, addressing and configuration.
- Corroborate relation filters and condition-selected topology against MyHOME Suite and controlled hardware observations.
