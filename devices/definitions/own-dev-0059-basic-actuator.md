# Basic actuator

## Summary

This compact SCS relay actuator switches a configured lighting or other documented load. Its basic-module format allows installation in a flush box, junction box, shutter box or trunking, with load-specific limits governing the relay output.

## Firmware and hardware

| Firmware ID | Version | Revision | Build | Declared Modules | Default | Catalogue status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `193` | `-1` | `-1` | `-1` | `1` | Catalogue default | Official |

Version/revision/build `-1` retains wildcard or unspecified applicability in the catalogue; it is distinct from Deprecated status. Status and default are metadata of this historical source snapshot, not present-day market availability or installed state. Installed firmware must be corroborated through the applicable diagnostic context.

## Module, Object, and Virgin Object model

| Firmware | Module slot | External Object | Catalogue placement | Catalogue slot row ID | Catalogue Object key | Object/Firmware relation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `193` | `1` | `6` Light actuator | Fixed/designated metadata | `689` | `6` | `478` |

Module slot is the Device-local placement, not a database row identifier. Fixed/designated metadata and candidate membership do not prove the installed active Object; use the conditions and runtime diagnostics in their established contexts.

### Virgin Objects

| Firmware | External Virgin Object | Module slots | Permitted external Objects | Catalogue Virgin Object key | Firmware/Virgin relation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| all | None associated | - | - | - | - |

## Configuration modes

| Firmware | Mode | Catalogue interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `193` | Advanced Configuration | supported configuration route for this Device family |
| `193` | Physical configuration | supported configuration route for this Device family |
| `193` | Virtual Configuration | supported configuration route for this Device family |

## Firmware-scoped configuration

Catalogue domains/defaults below are firmware-scoped, separate from the product-document and software Object domains. The source does not specify a default where the table says so.

| Firmware | Field | Catalogue domain | Catalogue default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `193` | `AID` | Identity template `********`; permitted character set not specified | Not specified in source | Device identity token; not a physical configurator |
| `193` | `A` | `0..9` | `0` | A; Environment |
| `193` | `PL` | `0..9` | `0` | PL; Light Point |
| `193` | `M` | `0..4`; `11` = `SLA`; `15` = `PUL` | `0` | M; Mode (0-4, Pul, Sla) |
| `193` | `G1` | `0..9` | `0` | G1; G1 - (0-9) |

## Object configuration surfaces

The following domains and defaults describe reusable Object definitions in the canonical MyHOME Suite `3.5.38` catalogue. Numeric values are catalogue values; product units and physical configurator limits are separate scopes. Defaults do not establish installed state. Apply the firmware-specific restrictions under Conditions, filters, and conversions after resolving the active Object.

### Object `6` - Light actuator

## Conditions, filters, and conversions

### Slot conditions

| Firmware | Module slot | External Object | Condition ID | Stored predicate | Conversion rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `193` | `1` | `6` | `4147` | No textual predicate stored | `1` |

Empty predicates, missing condition rows and fixed placement metadata are not evidence of unconditional runtime activation. Preserve out-of-domain selectors and unresolved symbols as source irregularities; do not invent selection precedence.

### Object/Firmware restrictions

| Firmware | External Object | Filter ID | Field | Effective catalogue domain | Reusable default | Evidence / applicability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `193` | `6` | `679` | `STATE_RESET` | `0` = Restore last value; `1` = Closed; `2` = Open (entire reusable range retained) | `0` | Per energy management (State on Reset) |
| `193` | `6` | `680` | `HOURS` | `0..255` (entire reusable range retained) | `0` | Hours |
| `193` | `6` | `681` | `MINUTES` | `0..59` (entire reusable range retained) | `0` | Minutes |
| `193` | `6` | `682` | `SECONDS` | `0..59` (entire reusable range retained) | `30` | Seconds |
| `193` | `6` | `1795` | `LOCAL_BUTTON` | `0` = Toggle; `1` = `ON`/`OFF`; `9` = `ON` - `OFF`; `15` = Pushbutton; `18` = Timed `ON` (entire reusable range retained) | `0` | Local button modality |
| `193` | `6` | `1867` | `LOAD_CONTROL_MODE` | `0` = With zero crossing; `1` = Without zero crossing (entire reusable range retained) | `0` | Load_control_mode |

### Device-specific conversions

| Referenced rule | Item-side condition | Object configuration result | Source path / limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `M=0` | `DELAYED_OFF` = `0`; `LOCAL_BUTTON` = `0`; `M` = `0` | `1` |
| `1` | `M=1` | `DELAYED_OFF` = `60`; `LOCAL_BUTTON` = `0`; `M` = `0` | `1` |
| `1` | `M=2` | `DELAYED_OFF` = `120`; `LOCAL_BUTTON` = `0`; `M` = `0` | `1` |
| `1` | `M=3` | `DELAYED_OFF` = `180`; `LOCAL_BUTTON` = `0`; `M` = `0` | `1` |
| `1` | `M=4` | `DELAYED_OFF` = `240`; `LOCAL_BUTTON` = `0`; `M` = `0` | `1` |
| `1` | `M=I/O` | `DELAYED_OFF` = `0`; `LOCAL_BUTTON` = `9`; `M` = `0` | `1` |
| `1` | `M=PUL` | `DELAYED_OFF` = `0`; `LOCAL_BUTTON` = `0`; `M` = `15` | `1` |
| `1` | `M=SLA` | `LOCAL_BUTTON` = `0`; `M` = `11` | `1` |

These maps describe stored conversion branches after Object selection. Validate input against the exact firmware domain and output against the selected Object/Firmware restriction; a stored symbolic branch may be unreachable on this firmware. Generic evaluation and ambiguity handling remain in [Catalogue Resolution](../../internals/catalogue-resolution.md).

## Diagnostic applicability

| Diagnostic surface | Device-specific use | Canonical reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIMENSION 1` | corroborate technical identity for catalogue item `54` / `modobj = 104` | [Device Identity](../../diagnostics/dim1-device-identity.md) |
| `DIMENSION 2` | select/corroborate the applicable catalogue firmware tuple while preserving wildcard semantics | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 30` | corroborate declared Module/Object topology (`6`) | [Modules](../../diagnostics/dim30-modules.md) |
| `DIMENSION 32` | corroborate addressing only after the active Module/Object context is resolved | [Addressing](../../diagnostics/dim32-addressing.md) |
| `DIMENSION 35` | inspect physical/software configuration against firmware fields, conditions and filters | [Configuration](../../diagnostics/dim35-configuration.md) |

## Functional applicability

Compact SCS relay actuator for basic lighting/load automation. The canonical item exposes one actuator Object and supports advanced, physical and virtual configuration.

## Observed behavior and corroboration

No additional publishable Device-specific hardware/runtime observation is currently retained for this exact technical item.

## Programming

Programming must select the applicable firmware, resolve active Module/Object relationships through catalogue conditions and filters, and preserve the documented configuration-mode boundary. Product-programmed Devices should not be reduced to generic physical-configurator semantics.

## Source reconciliation

The dedicated publisher sheet directly identifies `3475` as the Basic actuator. Current MyHOME Server compatibility documentation also lists it as a one-channel supported device from production batch `12W31`.

## Evidence limits and open work

- Archive the identified publisher documents locally where licensing and repository policy allow.
- Capture a sanitized hardware fingerprint covering identity, firmware, Modules, addressing and configuration.
- Corroborate relation filters and condition-selected topology against MyHOME Suite and controlled hardware observations.
