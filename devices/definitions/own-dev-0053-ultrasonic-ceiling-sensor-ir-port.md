| Slot conditions | `4145` | resolve Object/slot applicability before programming |
| Conversion rules | catalogue-scoped | preserve canonical condition/conversion evaluation; do not infer unconditional capability |

## Diagnostic applicability

| Diagnostic surface | Device-specific use | Canonical reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIMENSION 1` | corroborate technical identity for catalogue item `48` / `modobj = 33` | [Device Identity](../../diagnostics/dim1-device-identity.md) |
| `DIMENSION 2` | select/corroborate the applicable catalogue firmware tuple while preserving wildcard semantics | [Dimension Reference](../../diagnostics/dimension-reference.md) |
| `DIMENSION 30` | corroborate declared Module/Object topology (`119`, `128`, `164`, `165`, `166`, `168`, `431`) | [Modules](../../diagnostics/dim30-modules.md) |
| `DIMENSION 32` | corroborate addressing only after the active Module/Object context is resolved | [Addressing](../../diagnostics/dim32-addressing.md) |
| `DIMENSION 35` | inspect physical/software configuration against firmware fields, conditions and filters | [Configuration](../../diagnostics/dim35-configuration.md) |

## Functional applicability

Ceiling-mounted BUS sensor centered on ultrasonic presence detection, with IR configuration support. Its catalogue topology reuses the broad presence/daylight/scenario Object families of related ceiling sensors, with Device relation filters selecting applicable parameters.

## Observed behavior and corroboration

No additional publishable Device-specific hardware/runtime observation is currently retained for this exact technical item.

## Programming

Programming must select the applicable firmware, resolve active Module/Object relationships through catalogue conditions and filters, and preserve the documented configuration-mode boundary. Product-programmed Devices should not be reduced to generic physical-configurator semantics.

## Source reconciliation

The canonical catalogue identifies `BMSE3002` and `048821`. The publisher instruction sheet identifies `0 488 21` as the ultrasonic member of the `0 488 20/21/22` family, with `27 Vdc` supply and `16 mA` consumption. Shared Objects also contain PIR-oriented fields, so relation filters remain essential.

## Evidence limits and open work

- Archive the identified publisher documents locally where licensing and repository policy allow.
- Capture a sanitized hardware fingerprint covering identity, firmware, Modules, addressing and configuration.
- Corroborate relation filters and condition-selected topology against MyHOME Suite and controlled hardware observations.
